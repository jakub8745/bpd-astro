After several months of programming challenges, we are excited to announce the release of Beta 1.0 of our archive. In fact, a more advanced and optimized version is already in the works, and we plan to deploy it at the beginning of next year.

We’ve also set up redirects from old exhibitions to the archive, ensuring a smooth transition. From now on, each exhibition will remain live for one year before being moved to the archive.

Looking ahead, in December we'll be opening an extended exhibition of Lidio Cypriani's photography. This will be a continuation of the “Vincenz Dialogues-Views” project. We'll be introducing a "viewing terrace" and adding music, along with enhanced access to all materials related to the project.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for your continued support!
