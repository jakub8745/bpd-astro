I am currently preparing my solo exhibition the dystopia of an imitation. It will summarise the activities related to the grant I received from Arts Council England within the DYCP programme. Feel free to visit the project website.

Welcome to Web3! The exhibition environment has improved mechanics. I worked to improve the UX also.
This will be the first Blue Point Art exhibition hosted on the decentralised web. I use IPFS Hosting by Fleek.
