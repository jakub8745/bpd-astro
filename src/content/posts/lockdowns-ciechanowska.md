Joanna Ciechanowska’s works presented at the Lockdowns exhibition offer a specific understanding of isolation. They are anchored in multi-dimensional references to social and historical time, but above all – to personal time. Despite revealing fears related to participating in an unknown situation, they steer clear of catastrophism. They become the artist’s inner painting and poetic journey. They are a flash of rediscovery of those few simple images in the presence of which the human heart is closedand opened for the first time.
