A recording of a virtual installation in the form of a video-poem. A three-dimensional scan of an encountered object becomes an inspiration to explore _Bernini's_ work and further the Baroque concept of ‘total art’ and its ‘immersiveness’. In the work, I juxtapose a low poly scan of a random object with the sculpture _Ecstasy of St Teresa_ and simple background music. Here I refer to the idea of ‘dystopia of imitation‘’ where the attempt to imitate physical objects is essentially dystopian, but through, for example, a series of associations, a new, unanticipated value is created. All enhanced in its expression by montage. Author: Jaroslaw Solecki. The International Language and Cultural Centre of the Kenyatta University, Nairobi, 2023
