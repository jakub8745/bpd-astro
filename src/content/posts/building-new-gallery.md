I have completely redefined our gallery. It brings us closer to the concept of the metaverse. I have implemented 'first player' navigation with the ability to quickly move to a cursor-pointed location, also added a "joystick" and WASD and abandoned 'portals' because they introduce unnecessary context. I am experimenting with lights [8 pointLights and 2 spotLights so far - 120ftp] and shadows. I am not a fan of imitating the real world so lights and shadows will not be 'physically correct'. Lights turn on and off automatically when a visitor changes room. I've also started implementing asynchronous code. I am thrilled :))
