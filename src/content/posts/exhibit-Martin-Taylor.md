Ten Years & Counting – Martin Taylor's Solo Retrospective
Exhibition of Paintings organised by Blue Point Art Gallery"

**Opening at POSK Gallery London:** 16 March 2025
**Private View:** Tuesday, 18 March 2025
**Exhibition Dates:** 16 – 28 March 2025

We are delighted to invite you to **Martin Taylor’s Retrospective Solo Exhibition** — a unique showcase of his dynamic and emotionally charged paintings.

Curated by **Joanna Ciechanowska** and **Dr Justyna Gorzkowicz**, the exhibition features an accompanying **artbook** published by the **Union of Polish Writers Abroad** as part of their **Blue Point Art** series. The catalogue includes a curatorial introduction written by **Dr Justyna Gorzkowicz**, offering insightful reflections on Taylor's artistic journey and the expressive language of his works.

Born in Coatbridge, Scotland, **Martin Taylor** studied Ceramics and Design at **Gray’s School of Art** in Aberdeen. Since 1985, he has lived and worked in London, dedicating the past decade to his painting practice. His vibrant works, rich in texture and energy, are inspired by his experiences in Scotland, England, and Poland.

According to **Dr Justyna Gorzkowicz**, *“Taylor’s paintings are never still. They resemble a stream of consciousness transferred onto canvas. In compositions like* Looking into the Chaos *or the almost monochromatic* Avalanche, *we witness collisions between opposing energies, emerging through dramatic contrasts. Even in works such as* Happy Meadow *or* In My Jungle, *where Taylor seeks harmony and calm, there is a constant pulse of ambiguous energy. Dense rhythms, sweeping brushstrokes, and upward movement of colour create an impression of perpetual motion. Like a conductor shaping an orchestra, Taylor organises this painterly chaos, arranging colours and forms in a seemingly spontaneous yet carefully composed structure.”*

**Joanna Ciechanowska**, co-curator and Director of POSK Gallery, adds: *“It’s a rarity to see a painter who is obviously firmly into abstraction, yet commands the use of colour in such a suggestive manner. Landscapes, sea, trees — figures that never appear yet draw you in to show something that perhaps is only in the viewer’s mind. His mark-making is superbly executed, colours perfectly clashing — and all so... dare I say it, Scottish? Why and how? You have to see and judge for yourself. This selection feels like the start of a conversation — one that promises to keep surprising us.”*
