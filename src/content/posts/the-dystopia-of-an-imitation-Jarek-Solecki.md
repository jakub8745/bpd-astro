Our latest exhibition “The dystopia of an imitation” by Jarek Solecki marks a completely new direction in the development of the 3D Blue Point Art project. Jarek has transformed the gallery into an art object, an interactive art installation. He weaves the traditional role of the gallery as a place where art works are shown into conceptual reflections on giving artistic meaning to virtual objects. At the same time, the problem of imitating the world of physical objects in spaces like metawerse is tackled. On the technical side, the art installation has become an autonomous object placed in a decentralised network, whose exhibition function allows it to visualise the specific interaction of meanings given to digital objects, algorithms and data sequences. The exhibition in 3d Blue Point Art Gallery is inspired by Johanes Vermeer’s painting ‘the milkmaid‘.

Please feel free to explore “The dystopia of an imitation” by Jarek Solecki.
