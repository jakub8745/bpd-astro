„... It’s a rarity to see a painter who is obviously firmly into abstract, 
who commands the use of colour in such a suggestive manner.
Landscapes, sea, trees — figures that never appear yet draw you in to
show something that perhaps is only in the viewer’s mind. His markmaking
is superbly executed, colours perfectly clashing — and all so...
dare I say it, Scottish? Why and how? You have to see and judge for
yourself. This selection feels like the start of a conversation — one that
promises to keep surprising us.” — Joanna Ciechanowska, Director of
Gallery POSK, Co-curator of _Ten Years & Counting_ exhibition.
