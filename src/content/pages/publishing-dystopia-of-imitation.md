“Jaroslaw Solecki’s The Dystopia of an Imitation presents a creative way of exploring
the ‘matter’ of art. The central issue taken up in the work is the sculpting process realised
in stone, clay and in the form of digital 3D graphics. Solecki’s reflection on the
materialisation of an artistic work in relation to algorithm-based art is of undeniable value.
He also points out that the materialisation of the concept is ‘performed’ in the same way
that the viewer of graphic forms in 3D is ‘performed’ (guided by the artist creating the
computer generated images), which makes it easier to frame VR art through the perspective
of the performative turn in the humanities. […]”, Prof. Aleksandra Łukaszewicz
