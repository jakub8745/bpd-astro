We can have a legal duty to provide personal information to other organisations to prevent any crime or fraud. For all these reasons, the risk must be serious before we can override your right to privacy.

    Encryption, meaning that information is hidden so that it cannot be read without special knowledge (such as a password)
    Pseudonymisation, meaning that we can use a different name or identifier to hide parts of your personal information from view. This means that someone outside of Blue Point Art ltd could work on your information for us without ever knowing it was yours
    Controlling access to systems and networks allows us to stop people who are not allowed to view your personal information from getting access to it
    Training for our staff allows us to make them aware of how to handle personal information, and how and when to report when something goes wrong
    Regular testing of our technology and ways of working, including keeping up to date on the latest security updates (commonly called patches)

It relates to our relations with the UK and the fact Brexit is a fact.
